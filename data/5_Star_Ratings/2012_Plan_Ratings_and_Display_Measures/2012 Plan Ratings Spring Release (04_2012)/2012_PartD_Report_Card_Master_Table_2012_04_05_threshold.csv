,"NA* applies due to rounding and the placement of the predetermined 4-star cutoff, no contracts were assigned 4 base stars; all contracts meeting the cutoff for 4 base stars also met the cutoff for 5 base stars. However after application of the further criteria of significance and reliability, some plans with 5 base stars may have been assigned 4 final stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
